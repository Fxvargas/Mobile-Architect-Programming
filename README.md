# Mobile-Architect-Programming

The purpose of this application is to provide the user with the ability to store items into the app and modify them. It was a very basic and simple inventory app that does just that. The process of developing the app was just figuring out the requirements of it and deciding where I will implement those requirements. This can be applied in the future by taking notes when getting the information on what the app requires and thinking about how those requirements will be met. Designing the layout took many trials and errors since I had to re-run the app several times until I got a layout that I was satisfied with.
I think the area where I was able to develop a lot of skills was implementing SQLite into the app. I was able to create a table and manage it via CRUD method. After each function was created in the app, I tested each and made sure that the app was able to modify the database as required.
